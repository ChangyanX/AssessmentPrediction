# AssessmentPrediction
Applying machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

## 
We measured the performance of the learning system in terms of prediction accuracy =

\(E=mc^2\)，$$x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2b}.$$

prediction accuracy = the number of correct predictions / the number of total predictions
