# AssessmentPrediction
In part A, we applied machine learning algorithms (e.g. kNN, Matrix Factorization, Neural Networks) to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

We measured the performance of the learning system in terms of prediction accuracy, where

In part B, we particularly enhanced the Matrix Factorization implemented with ALS approach by optimizing the learning rate and adding L2 regularizations. The accuracy had been boosted to 70.76%.
